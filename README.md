# Baseline Models for EEG Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains resources and codebase for developing and evaluating baseline models for EEG (Electroencephalogram) data analysis. It's structured to facilitate easy understanding and navigation for both research and development purposes. The repository is divided into key sections: baseline models, Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations, and scripts for preprocessing, analysis, and utility functions.

## Baseline Models

The `baseline` directory houses the core models that serve as a starting point or "baseline" for EEG data analysis. These models are designed to provide a foundation upon which further customizations and improvements can be built.

## Notebooks

Contained within the `notebooks` directory, Jupyter notebooks are provided for demonstration purposes. These notebooks illustrate how the baseline models can be applied to EEG data, including preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory includes various scripts that support the preprocessing of EEG data, execution of models, and other utility functions necessary for managing the data analysis workflow.
